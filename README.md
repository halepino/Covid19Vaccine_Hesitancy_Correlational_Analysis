# Vaccine Hesitancy Correlational Analysis

### Author: https://github.com/halepino

## Overview
This project was designed to draw insights into hesistant attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccination. Corrrelational analysis was conducted between hesitancy data, reports of Covid-19 impacts, demographics, and political influences at state and county levels. Census Bureau datasets were gathered on the topic of Covid-19 impact, income loss during the pandemic, eviction or expecting eviction.

## Data Sources
Three datasets total were included for this project. Attitudes for hesitancy and distributions for race/ethinicity were gathered from the [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-County-and-local-es/q9mh-h2tw/data). Data for 2020 election results were used as a proxy for party influence at the county and state levels. This dataset was sourced from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/us-election-2020). Variables for delayed medical care, expected eviction, eviction, lost income, and expected income loss were sourced from the Census Bureau's [Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html) After some initial analysis, the final combined dataset for correlation was aggregated at the state level including the following variables.
